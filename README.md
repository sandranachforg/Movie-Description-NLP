One of the fastest growing areas in AI and Machine Learning is Natural Language Processing. Textual data contains rich, invaluable information 
and can help us make better decisions when formulating press releases, tweets and headlines. 

This project focuses on basic feature extraction that can help us better understand movie descriptions.

I wondered whether long movie descriptions automatically assumes a longer duration of the movie and what words are most commonly used in Dramas vs. Horror movies. 

The results where quite intriguing! :)
