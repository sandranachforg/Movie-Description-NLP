One of the fastest growing areas in AI and Machine Learning is Natural Language Processing. Textual data contains rich, invaluable information 
and can help us make better decisions when formulating press releases, tweets and headlines. 

This project focuses on basic feature extraction that can help us better understand movie descriptions and textual data.

Some of the questions I tried to answer were whether long movie descriptions automatically indicate long movies.
I also applied the Bag-of-Words method to count how often different words appear in the description of dramas and horror movies of highly rated movies. 

**How is this useful?**

With the influx of tv shows and movies on Netflix and other streaming services, producers have to make though decisions on what scripts promise a high return and ratings. Natural Language Processing can help us to identify popular themes within the movie descriptions and contribute to improved decision making.

The results are quite intriguing! :)
